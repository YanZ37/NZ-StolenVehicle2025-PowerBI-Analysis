# 🚗 Vehicle Theft Trends in New Zealand (2025)

## Project Overview

This project presents a **visual analysis of vehicle theft incidents in New Zealand in 2025**, using aggregated crime data to identify patterns across **time, vehicle characteristics, and location**.

The analysis is designed to demonstrate **applied crime and public-sector data analytics**, with a focus on **pattern detection, situational risk, and briefing-level insights** rather than predictive modelling.

## Purpose & Relevance

Vehicle theft remains a persistent issue with implications for:
- crime prevention and policing strategies,
- insurance risk and loss mitigation,
- public awareness and situational crime prevention.

This project shows how **descriptive analytics and visualisation** can be used to:
- identify high-risk vehicle characteristics,
- highlight temporal and geographic patterns,
- support evidence-informed prevention discussions.

---

## Key Questions Explored

- How do vehicle theft incidents vary **by month**?
- Which **vehicle types** are most frequently stolen?
- Which **makes and models** appear most often in theft data?
- Are certain **vehicle colours** or **build types** more commonly targeted?
- How are theft incidents distributed across **police districts**?

---

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes:

- **Monthly trend analysis** of stolen vehicle cases
- **Top stolen vehicle types** (e.g. station wagon, hatchback, saloon)
- **Counts by make and model**
- **Ranking of stolen vehicle colours**
- **Build type comparison**
- **Geographic distribution by police district**

Visuals are designed for **rapid interpretation and briefing use**.

## Data Source

- Publicly available New Zealand vehicle theft data (aggregated)

⚠️ **Data notes:**
- Analysis is descriptive, not causal
- Data reflects reported theft incidents only
- Counts may be influenced by reporting practices and detection rates

---

## Methods & Approach

- Data aggregation and validation
- Descriptive statistical analysis
- Visual pattern analysis
- Dashboard design focused on clarity and accessibility

The emphasis is on **interpretation and situational insight**, not advanced modelling.
